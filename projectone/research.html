  <p> For this project, Kevin and I decided to go to Pier 1, Riverside Park. The pier looks out to the Hudson River and it overlooks the New Jersey skyline. 
    It is a beautiful public space for people to take a stroll, walk their pups, do some fishing, exercise or just relax. I love coming here because it is very quiet and I love
    hearing the waves crashing onto the pier. Prior to our outing, we did a quick research on the site and we found out that it used to be a part of the abandoned 
    Penn Central Railyard. Today, it is a beautiful pier for people to enjoy.</p>
