        For this project, Kevin and I decided to go to Pier 1, Riverside Park. The pier looks out to the Hudson River and it overlooks 
        the New Jersey skyline. It is a beautiful public space for people to take a stroll, walk their pups, do some fishing, exercise 
        or just relax. I love coming here because it is very quiet and I love hearing the waves crashing onto the pier. Prior to our 
        outing, we did a quick research on the site and we found out that it used to be a part of the abandoned Penn Central Railyard. 
        Today, it is a beautiful pier for people to enjoy.

        In this assignment, we were asked to partner with our classmate and exchange descriptions of one object that we lost.
        I was partnered with Lynette and she described to me her card holder that went missing. She has given me really detailed
        description, in human language, on the shape, the color and certain specific features.
        <br><br>
        I started out with sketching out the image on paper, referencing her descriptions on my computer. After I had a good idea
        on what the cardholder looks like, I determined how big the cardholder would be on the 400x400 px canvas. Determining the
        dimensions helped me with the coordinates of the specific features.
        <br><br>
        Starting out from the bottom layer, I created the shape of the cardholder using primitive shapes - rectangles and arcs.
        I built out two narrow rectangles and added different shades of brown to portray the card slots. In order to create "A,P.C",
        I was initally going to build that out with triangles, but I found a code online, text()function, that would help me type out 
        the letters itself. Next, I build out the "fabric lining" using line() function. I added a OVERLAY blendmode to create some
        dimension on the fabric lining.

        I enjoyed working on this assignment, especially being able to create something out of code
        and working on little details. I had a few challenges but it was really exciting to me when
        I was able to look for the solution online and applied to my code. I would love to explore more
        functions in P5.js and also other languages!
