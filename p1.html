        For this project, Kevin and I decided to go to Pier 1, Riverside Park. The pier looks out to the Hudson River and it overlooks 
        the New Jersey skyline. It is a beautiful public space for people to take a stroll, walk their pups, do some fishing, exercise 
        or just relax. I love coming here because it is very quiet and I love hearing the waves crashing onto the pier. Prior to our 
        outing, we did a quick research on the site and we found out that it used to be a part of the abandoned Penn Central Railyard. 
        Today, it is a beautiful pier for people to enjoy.

      <p>
        For our first research, we did the AEIOU exerecise. We sat on one of the benches at the pier, observed some strangers and note 
        down a few things that stood out. It was really exciting to see the diverse activities that are happening on the pier. There 
        were some people fishing, sunbathing, flying kites, resting after an exercise, taking a stroll with their partner, cycling, etc.

        I enjoyed working on this assignment, especially being able to create something out of code
        and working on little details. I had a few challenges but it was really exciting to me when
        I was able to look for the solution online and applied to my code. I would love to explore more
        functions in P5.js and also other languages!
