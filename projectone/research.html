<h1>Project 1: Instruction Sets for Strangers</h1>
  <h3> Collaborator: <a href="https://huaigulin.github.io/major-studio-portfolio/"> Kevin Lin</a></h3>
  <h2> Location </h2>
  <img style="width: 800px;" src="https://www.aaa.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Pier-1-Cafe-Hudson-River-W70th-TA01-855x500.jpg" />
  <p> For this project, Kevin and I decided to go to Pier 1, Riverside Park. The pier looks out to the Hudson River and it overlooks the New Jersey skyline. 
    It is a beautiful public space for people to take a stroll, walk their pups, do some fishing, exercise or just relax. I love coming here because it is very quiet and I love
    hearing the waves crashing onto the pier. Prior to our outing, we did a quick research on the site and we found out that it used to be a part of the abandoned 
    Penn Central Railyard. Today, it is a beautiful pier for people to enjoy.</p>
  <h2> Research and Brainstorming </h2>
  <h3> AEIOU </h3>

  <p> For our first research, we did the AEIOU exerecise. We sat on one of the benches at the pier, observed some strangers and note down a few things that stood out.
    It was really exciting to see the diverse activities that are happening on the pier. There were some people fishing, sunbathing, flying kites, resting after an exercise,
    taking a stroll with their partner, cycling, etc. </p>
  <h3> Behaviorial Mapping </h3>

  <p> Additionally, we did a behaviorial mapping on some of the users on the pier. One thing we noticed is that most people walk all the way down to the end of the
    pier. For those who are exercising or on a call, they will immediately turn back, but for those who are resting or just taking a stroll, most of them would find an 
    empty bench. </p>

  <h3> Concept 1 </h3>
  <img style=" width: 800 px;" src="https://huaigulin.github.io/major-studio-portfolio/public/img/cs.jpg" />
  <p> For our initial idea, we decided to focus on the ramp. During our research, we noticed that most people used the ramp to go up and down the pier. Furthermore, people who are
    cycling, using their scooters, pushing a stroller or someone who is physically disabled , could access the ramp too. Our goal is to celebrate this simple and functional product.
    We came up with an idea to create a game on this ramp, a game where all users are able to interact with. The idea is to add 8 circles on the floor, all with different colors. 
    The look and placement of the circles would reflect a hopscotch game, where we hope that users will try and step on them. When the user stepped on them, a musical note will play.
    When the users realized this, they could play music by stepping on the different circles. </p>
