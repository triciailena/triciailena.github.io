      <p>
        For this project, Kevin and I decided to go to Pier 1, Riverside Park. The pier looks out to the Hudson River and it overlooks 
        the New Jersey skyline. It is a beautiful public space for people to take a stroll, walk their pups, do some fishing, exercise 
        or just relax. I love coming here because it is very quiet and I love hearing the waves crashing onto the pier. Prior to our 
        outing, we did a quick research on the site and we found out that it used to be a part of the abandoned Penn Central Railyard. 
        Today, it is a beautiful pier for people to enjoy.

      <p>
        For our first research, we did the AEIOU exerecise. We sat on one of the benches at the pier, observed some strangers and note 
        down a few things that stood out. It was really exciting to see the diverse activities that are happening on the pier. There 
        were some people fishing, sunbathing, flying kites, resting after an exercise, taking a stroll with their partner, cycling, etc.

      <h2> Behaviorial Mapping </h2>
      <img style=" width:800px; height:auto; " src="https://huaigulin.github.io/major-studio-portfolio/public/img/MS1_BM.png" />
      <p>
        Additionally, we did a behaviorial mapping on some of the users on the pier. One thing we noticed is that most people walk all 
        the way down to the end of the pier. For those who are exercising or on a call, they will immediately turn back, but for those 
        who are resting or just taking a stroll, most of them would find an empty bench.

      <p>
        I enjoyed working on this assignment, especially being able to create something out of code
        and working on little details. I had a few challenges but it was really exciting to me when
        I was able to look for the solution online and applied to my code. I would love to explore more
        functions in P5.js and also other languages!

      <p>For our initial idea, we decided to focus on the ramp. During our research, we noticed that most 
         people used the ramp to go up and down the pier. Furthermore, people who are cycling, using their 
         scooters, pushing a stroller or someone who is physically disabled , could access the ramp too. 
         The idea is to add 8 circle on the floor, all with different colors. The look and placement of the 
         circles would reflect a hopscotch game, where we hope that users will try and step on them. When 
         the user stepped on them, a musical note will play. When the users realized this, they could play 
         music by stepping on the different circles.
